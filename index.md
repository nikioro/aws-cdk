### Cognito Identity Pool

Amazon  Cognito  provides  authentication,  authorization,  and  user  management  for  your  web  and  mobile apps.  Your  users  can  sign  in  directly  with  a  user  name  and  password,  or  through  a  third  party  such  as Facebook,  Amazon,  Google  or  Apple. The  two  main  components  of  Amazon  Cognito  are  user  pools  and  identity  pools.  User  pools  are  user directories  that  provide  sign-up  and  sign-in  options  for  your  app  users.  Identity  pools  enable  you  to grant  your  users  access  to  other  AWS  services.  You  can  use  identity  pools  and  user  pools  separately  or together.
